description=This plugin prepares the input rasters for the Rockyfor3D rockfall simulation model.
version=0.1
author=Alexandra Erbach
email=alexandra.erbach@bfh.ch

about=Based on a digital elevation model (DEM) and a polygon or line input (terrain / forest / rockfall nets), the algorithm rasterizes the attributes from the vector layer, ensuring alignment of all output rasters with the DEM grid, and the correct output format of all data (ASCII grid). The tool includes internal checks for invalid or missing geometries, mismatched coordinate reference systems (CRS), and missing values. In addition, attributes are validated against predefined type and value constraints that reflect the expectations of the Rockyfor3D model. The user is informed if any values fall outside expected ranges or if data types do not match. For the ROCKDENSITY raster, the tool performs an additional check to identify values in the two outer rows or columns of the raster, which will not be considered in the Rockyfor3D simulation.
